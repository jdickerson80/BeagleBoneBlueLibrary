/**
 * @brief	The Input class represents a GPIO pin that is set up as an input. This class allows the user to
 *			add a callback function to either the rising, falling, or both edges of the input. This means
 *			that the function will automatically be called when its respective edge event happens.
 *			There are two different ways to use the edge callback:
 *				1) waitForEdge() - where it blocks until the edge event happens.
 *				2) waitForEdgeThreaded - which does the same thing, without blocking.
 *			If edge events are undesired, there are standard methods to just query the state of the input.
 *
 * @note	To construct an input, just create the setup struct, and pass the struct into the inputs's
 *			constructor. The setup struct, however, does not need to be kept in scope after it is passed
 *			to the constructor. This means that one could create the setup struct in the constructor
 *			of the input.
 *
 * @note	Upon construction, if there is a callback function in the Setup structure,
 *			the constructor will automatically call the threaded wait for edge.
